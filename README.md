| Not pre-compiled, instead parsed and compiled "on the fly" (e.g. in the browser) | Data types are assumed (e.g. assigned to variables) automatically               |
| Code evaluated and executed at runtime                                           | You don't define that some variable has to hold a certain value (e.g. a number) |
| Code can change at runtime (e.g. type of a variable)                             | Data type are not set in stone but can change                                   |
